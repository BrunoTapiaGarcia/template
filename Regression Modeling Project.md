Objective
The bike sharing industry has grown tremendously in recent years, with an estimated global value of $2.8 billion in 2023. 
This is due to a number of factors, such as convenience, sustainability, and physical fitness. As a result of the market's growth, 
your client, a major city in the United States, has tasked you with developing a machine learning model to predict the number of 
bike rentals on a given day, as well as to provide insights into the factors that contribute to bike rental demand.


The Client
The Cook County Planning and Development Department, responsible for the Chicago metropolitan area in the United States.

Modeling Steps 

Package and Dataset Imports
Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing
EDA - descriptive statistics, histograms, correlation, etc.
DP - missing value imputation, transformations, etc.
Feature Engineering (at least three features have been engineered and their rationales have been explained)
Candidate Model Development
One model from each permitted modeling type has been developed (see Permitted Model Types). Choose your best model from each model type.
Hyperparameter tuning has been performed on your top three models.
Final Model Selection
It is clear which model was selected as the final model and the rationale for choosing this model is sound.
